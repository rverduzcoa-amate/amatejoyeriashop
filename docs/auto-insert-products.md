Auto-insert product entries into `js/products.js`

What this does
- Scans a local images folder for `.jpg` files and generates product objects.
- Adds new objects to the requested category array inside `js/products.js`.
- Creates a timestamped backup of `js/products.js` before writing.
- Supports a `--dry-run` mode that shows the objects without modifying files.

Prerequisites
- Node.js installed.

Usage

```
node tools/auto_insert_products.js --category aretes --dir media/img/aretes --price "$299" --dry-run

// To actually write changes (creates a backup):
node tools/auto_insert_products.js --category aretes --dir media/img/aretes --price "$299"
```

Behavior
- `id` is generated from the filename: category singular + `_` + sanitized filename (non-alphanumeric replaced with `_`).
- `nombre` is generated by humanizing the filename (capitalized words).
- `precio` uses the `--price` value (default `$299`).
- `img` uses the relative path you supplied in `--dir`.
- Images already present in `js/products.js` are skipped.

Examples
- Add new `aretes` images into `js/products.js` (dry run):

```
node tools/auto_insert_products.js -c aretes -d media/img/aretes -p "$299" --dry-run
```

If you'd like the script to follow a different id naming pattern or to support multiple image fields (arrays), tell me and I will update it.
